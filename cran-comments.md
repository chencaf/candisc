## Test environments
* local Windows 7 install, 3.5.3 
* win-builder R Under development (unstable) (2020-01-03 r77629)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.  There was one NOTE:

** running examples for arch 'i386' ... [32s] NOTE
Examples with CPU or elapsed time > 10s
                user system elapsed
heplot.candisc 18.25   0.11   18.89

I have already made most of the examples \dontrun{}, but would prefer not to reduce the
number of run-able examples further.

## Comments
This is a quite minor release, cleaning up some documentation problems and notes.
